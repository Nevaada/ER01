# Goal

The project is to study the ping latency according to the size of sent packets in order to get the bandwidth using the formula ping=latency+size/bandwidth.

-----------------------------

# Getting the data

First we get data by using the following shell command:

ping -c 1 -s unifsize www.youtube.com | tail -1 | awk '{print$4}' | cut -d '/' -f 2
where unifsize is a randomly picked packet size between 100 bits and 1400 bits.

We thus use a small python script to get a huge number of values. It just takes
a file name and a number of values to produce and save data as (packet_size,ping_time) couples in a .csv file to be analyzed.

-----------------------------

# Analysis, conclusion

With R, the data is loaded to plot a graph ping_time~packet_size. We use a linear regression to get an approximation on the bandwidth. The equation of the linear regression and the graph obtained with ggplot are stored as a .png file.
